# Q1(a). Produce an appropriate figure to compare the distribution of lifespan among the five experimental groups of fruitflies. What figure did you produce?
# produce side-by-side boxplots to compare the distribution of lifespan among the five experimental groups of fruitflies
# For this we use a box plot to plot the lifespan and the type of fruit fly
boxplot(fruitfly$lifespan ~ fruitfly$type, xlab = "Type of Experimental Assignment", ylab = "Lifespan (days)")

# Q1(b). Identify the group with the shortest average lifespan and provide the mean and standard deviation of lifespan among this group.
# group 5 has the shortest average lifespan according to the side-by-side boxplots
